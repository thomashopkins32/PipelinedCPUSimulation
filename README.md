Repository for CSCI 2500 Final Project.

## To-do list:
(put your name next to what you want to work on)

Please comment your code so we know what everything does.

### - Handling Input (Completed)
  - ~~parse registers into an std::map<std::string, int>~~
  - ~~create an instruction object for each line in the input file~~
    ~~(including labels)~~
  - ~~put each instruction in a vector of instructions~~
  - ~~set up instruction object with useful variables for storing information in~~
    ~~a line~~
### - Pipelining structure (Completed)
  - ~~create basic structure for pipeline~~
  - ~~implement each step of the pipeline (IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB)~~
### - Handling Hazards (currently working on this: Jason)
  - ~~Data Hazards (exactly like homework 5)~~
  - Control Hazards (jumping and branching)
  - ~~inserting nop's in correct places~~
### - Implementing forwarding (Completed)
  - ~~Used for data hazards to not require a stall~~
  - ~~easier than it sounds~~
### - Output Formatting (Completed)
  - ~~match output format with examples on pdf~~

Replace when you are done with each step
- means unfinished
- ~~means finished~~
